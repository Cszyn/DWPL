The morally correct free software license

Two types of licenses are made available:
- DWPL (Dawn Winery Public License): The standard license, that excludes all harmful elements from being licensed
- LDWPL (Lesser Dawn Winery Public License): A modified version of the DWPL that also allows the user that goes by @osubsd to be licensed. Legally necessary for dwb (Dawn Winery Blog) to exist.
